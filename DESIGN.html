<body>
<b>Name:</b> Peter Bengtson<p>

I made 3 seperate files for the unique concepts. VRM, vehicles, and nodes. <br>
This allows for easy navigation through the code and understanding of related concepts. <p>

I made ID simply start at 1 and increment each time a new car was stored. <br>
This removed possible error (dublicates or typos) while manually typing ID's when adding a new vehicle. <p>

A point for improvement could have been using a Super call for the constructors, as the data laregely overlapped. <p>
